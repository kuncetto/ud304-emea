You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

My response below! ;)
  * I have learned how to use HTML tags and and search for them on the online documentation to make HTML page as much similar as the mockup.
  * Rendering titles and paragraphs with <h1>, <h2> and <p> tags, or highlight contents with <em> and <strong> tags has been quite easy.
  * Hints about superscript and horizontal rule in project instructions have made less difficult to add footnote and horizontal line.
  * First I have used what I learned in the classroom, then I have searched for new stuff on MDN documentation (and Google too!).

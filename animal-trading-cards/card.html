			<p class="description">
				Commonly referred to as the beluga, melonhead, or sea canary due to its high-pitched twitter. 
				They are gregarious and form groups of up to 10 animals on average, although during the summer, they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in estuaries and shallow coastal areas. 
				They are slow swimmers, but can dive to 700 m (2,300 ft) below the surface.
